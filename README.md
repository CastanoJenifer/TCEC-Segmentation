# Automated Brain Lesion Segmentation Pipeline (TBI)

This repository provides a **complete neuroimaging pipeline** for automated **brain lesion segmentation** using **ROBEX**, **ANTs**, and **nnU-Net**.  
It is specifically designed for **closed traumatic brain injury (TBI)** lesion segmentation on **T1-weighted MRI scans**.

The pipeline performs:

- Skull stripping  
- Atlas-based registration  
- Intensity normalization  
- Deep learning segmentation with nnU-Net  

Once the Docker container is executed, the entire processing pipeline runs automatically.

This project provides:
- Automated brain extraction (ROBEX)
- Spatial normalization using ANTs
- Intensity normalization methods
- Lesion segmentation using nnU-Net
- A fully reproducible Docker environment

No manual commands are required inside the container.  
All processing is executed automatically when Docker starts.

## Instructions

#### 1. Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone <this-repository>
```
#### 2. Download [ROBEX](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/robex) for Linux.
#### 3. Move the ROBEX folder. Place the downloaded ROBEX folder inside the cloned repository.
#### 4. Give execution permissions.
```bash
chmod +x ./ROBEX/ROBEX
```
#### 5. Download the required files from [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DaNsrBZot7z07-ihFZdEv-TGTAJxvvHS?usp=drive_link) Place them into the indicated folders inside the repository.
#### 6. Add your MRI scans. Make sure the images you want to process are located inside the input folder.
#### 7. Install PyTorch following the official installation instructions (Conda or Pip).
#### 8. Move into the container folder and run Docker.
```bash
cd container
docker compose up --build
```
Once the Docker container is running, the entire pipeline executes automatically. To modify the workflow, all functionality is located in:
```bash
pipeline.py
```

## Usage Notes
#### No manual commands are needed inside the container.
#### All preprocessing and segmentation is automatic.
#### Results are saved automatically in the output directory.
